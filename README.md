# Computer-Science-Capstone

My Computer Science Capstone Project implements a machine learning algorithm to predict housing prices using a training and testing dataset obtained from Kaggle
The dataset can be found from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The Capstone Document above goes into the specifics regarding the implementation, development, and purpose of the project
